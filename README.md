### What I learned

1. React Router Dom - I worked through learning more about React Router Dom. I went to W3 schools to learn about how it works with everything to route to different pages including structuring of the page. Additionally, I debugged a piece about not creating self-closing tags for the beginnning of the React Router Dom.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
